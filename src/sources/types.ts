 * A Source represents any data source that can be indexed:
 * - GitHub repositories

 * - **Indexing**: fetchAll, fetchChanges, getMetadata

 *
 * When a source can determine what changed since the last sync,
 * it returns this structure. If incremental updates aren't possible
 * (e.g., force push, ignore file changes), the source returns null.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const changes = await source.fetchChanges(previousMetadata);
 * if (changes) {
 *   console.log(`${changes.added.length} added, ${changes.removed.length} removed`);
 * } else {

 * - **Incremental indexing**: `fetchChanges()` to get only what changed

 * - **Client access**: `listFiles()` and `readFile()` for tools
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a source
 * const source = new GitHubSource({ owner: "my-org", repo: "my-project" });

 * // For indexing
 * const files = await source.fetchAll();
 * const metadata = await source.getMetadata();

   * - Creating a new index
   * - Incremental update isn't possible
   * - Force re-index is requested
   *
   * Files are automatically filtered based on:
   * - .augmentignore patterns
   * - Built-in filters (binary files, large files, secrets)
   * - .gitignore patterns
   *
   * @returns Array of all indexable files with their contents

   * - Force push detected
   * - Ignore files (.gitignore, .augmentignore) changed
   * - Too many changes to process efficiently
   * - Source doesn't support incremental updates
   *
   * @param previous - Metadata from the previous sync
   * @returns FileChanges if incremental possible, null otherwise
